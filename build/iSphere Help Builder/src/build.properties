# Sample Help Builder build properties
# A project that uses the help builder, must create a copy of this 
# file, rename it to 'helpbuilder.properties' and adjust the properties.
# Before calling the help builder build.xml, the project must copy
# its own 'helpbuilder.properties' file to the help builder project
# creating or overwriting an existing file in 'iSphere HelpBuilder/build'.

# Build project name (path from workspace)
# Specifies the name of the help builder project.
# Should not be changed.
# Default: iSphere Help Builder
build.project.name=\

# Output path to 'menu.js'
# Specifies the path to 'menu.js'. This file is generated by the 
# help builder and contains the Java Script code for expanding and
# collapsing the menu tree node.

build.output.file=\
   ./upload/assets/menu.js
