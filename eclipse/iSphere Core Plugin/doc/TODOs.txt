iSphere TODO List
-----------------

* Add "copy to" option to the iSphere source file search result view.
* Enable the new hex editor for user spaces.
* Display first bunch of messages in a list, when the messages monitor
  starts.  

* Change embedded SQL from *SYS to *SQL syntax wherever possible.
* Qualify SQL statements with QSYS2 library.

* Think about how to ignore comments in iSphere source file search.
