<h3>The iSphere Project</h3>
<p>
The iSphere Open Source Project aims to deliver high quality extensions for 
WDSC, RDP and RDi to fill gaps and to ease a programmer's live. 
Although IBM's current Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is 
a great step forward compared to SEU, it still lacks a lot of features that are 
available on the green screen only. That is where the iSphere Project comes 
into play, trying to fill the gap.</p> 
<p>
Basically iSphere is driven from our ideas and inspirations but of course 
everybody is encouraged to contribute his ideas and manpower to improve the 
power of iSphere. We greatly appreciate any support regarding to development, 
translation, beta testing or documentation.</p>
