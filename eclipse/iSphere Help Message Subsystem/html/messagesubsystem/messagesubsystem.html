	<h1>Message Subsystem</h1>

	</a> With the iSphere Message Subsystem you can manage and monitor
	messages on an IBM i server:
	<ul>
		<li>View and delete messages, with filters.</li>
		<li>Reply to inquery messages.</li>
		<li>Create an alert for new messages, using a dialog, an email or
			a beep.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The iSphere Message Subsystem integrates into the Remote Systems
		Explorer as shown below. From there you can use the context menu
		(right click)to create message filters or to perform actions on
		selected messages.
	<p>

	<p>Use the iSphere Messages context menu (right click) to create
		filters for your messages.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/create_filter.png" align="middle">
	<p>Use the message file context menu  (right click) to rename a message filter or
		to change the filter properties.
	<p>

	<p>Use the message file context menu  (right click) to remove or view the message
		details.

	<p>Answer inquery messages from the message detail dialog:

	<h2>Monitoring Messages</h2>
	<p>You can also use the iSphere message subsystem to monitor the
		message queue of your user profile in the background. When a new
		message is added to the message queue you can be notified by:
	<ul>
		<li>a message dialog</li>
		<li>a "beep" of your computer</li>
		<li>an email</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Use the context menu (right click) of the <i>iSphere Messages</i> node to configure
		the message monitor.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/message_monitor_properties.png" align="middle">
	<p>The message monitor requires an <b>exclusive lock</b> on your message
		queue. It will not get the lock if the messsage queue is locked by
		another job, such as a 5250 session. Therefore it is recommended you
		start RDi/WDSCi before any 5250 session.
	<p>
		The message queue is not immediately unlocked when option <i>Monitor
			message queue</i> is unchecked. It can take up to 20 seconds until the
		lock has been removed.
	<h2>End Message Monitor</h2>
	<p>Message monitoring ends, when the <i>Monitor message queue</i> checkbox is
	   unchecked. That may take up to 20 seconds, because of the receive message
	   timeout. You can also end the message monitor from a 5250 command line or
	   any program by sending <i>*END_MONITORING</i> to a monitored message queue
	   like this:
	<p>   
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="code">SNDMSG MSG('*END_MONITORING') TOUSR(user_profile)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>You need to check the <i>Monitor message queue</i> checkbox again to
	   start the message monitor again.
	<p>
	<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
	<p>Over several  months,  many on the WDSC_L mailing list at
		midrange.com have asked us to adopt the Message Subsystem feature from
		the RSE Extensions Plugin of Softlandings Systems.
	<p>In our opinion, forking another open source project is
		difficult, but sometimes there are good reasons to do this. If the
		original contributor cannot provide further support and enhancements,
		for whatever reasons, it benefits the community if others are willing
		to do this. This is the spirit of open source and everyone who starts
		an open source project has to be aware of this.
	<p>So, we decided to adopt the Message Subsystem feature from
		the RSE Extensions Plugin to iSphere. If anyone has a feature request
		regarding the Message Subsystem, please let us know immediately.
