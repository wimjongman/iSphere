The iSphere Open Source Project aims to deliver high quality extensions for WDSC, RDP and RDi to fill 
the gaps and to ease a programmer's live.
<p>
Altough IBM's current Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a great step forward
compared to SEU, it still lacks a lot of features available on the green screen only. That is where
the iSphere Project comes into play, trying to fill the gap.
<p>
Basically iSphere is driven from our ideas and inspirations but of course everybody is encouraged 
to contribute his ideas and manpower to improve the power of iSphere.
