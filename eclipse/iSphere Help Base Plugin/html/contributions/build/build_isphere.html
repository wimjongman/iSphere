<h1>Build iSphere</h1>
<p>
The iSphere build process is controlled by Ant build files. The main build file is "build.xml" of
the "iSphere Build" project. This files performs the following main steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the iSphere library from the host.</li>
<li>Building the iSphere plug-ins.</li>
<li>Creating the SourceForge files.</li>
<li>Uploading the SourceForge files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most current build instructions can be found at the top of the build script.
<p>
The second build file is "build.xml" of the "iSphere Help Builder" project. It is used to create the
iSphere Internet help pages from the iSphere help projects. This way we can use the same help pages 
for the Eclipse help as well as for the Internet help.
<p>
This build script is run from the main build script. But it can also be run stand-alone to execute
the following main build steps:
<p>
The build process is controlled by two configurations files. Both files are located in the "iSphere Build"
project.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Call the HelpBuilder Java class to create the Internet help.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u>build.properties</u>
<p>

The properties file contains a detailed description of each property.
<p>
<u>ftp.properties</u>
<p>
This properties file describes the properties that are required to download the iSphere library from the
host and the properties used for uploading files to SourceForge. Each property is decribed in the
properties file.
