<h1>Build iSphere</h1>
<p>
<h2>Ant Build</h2>
<p>
The iSphere build process is controlled by Ant build files. The main build file is "build.xml" of
the "iSphere Build" project. This files performs the following main steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the iSphere library from the host.</li>
<li>Building the iSphere plug-ins.</li>
<li>Creating the SourceForge files.</li>
<li>Uploading the SourceForge files.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most current build instructions can be found at the top of the build script.
<p>
The second build file is "build.xml" of the "iSphere Help Builder" project. It is used to create the
iSphere Internet help pages from the iSphere help projects. This way we can use the same help pages 
for the Eclipse help as well as for the Internet help.
<p>
This build script is run from the main build script. But it can also be run stand-alone to execute
the following main build steps:
<p>
The build process is controlled by two configurations files. Both files are located in the "iSphere Build"
project.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Call the HelpBuilder Java class to create the Internet help.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u>build.properties</u>
<p>
This properties file configures what is build and what projects are used to build the iSphere plug-in.
The properties file contains a detailed description of each property.
<p>
<u>ftp.properties</u>
<p>
This properties file describes the properties that are required to download the iSphere library from the
host and the properties used for uploading files to SourceForge. Each property is decribed in the
properties file.
<p>
<table>
<tr><td class="important" >Please also notice the "build.dryrun" property of the "build.properties" file. 
When set to <i>true</i> nothing is deleted or uploaded. It is just simulated.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h2>Version Numbering</h2>
<p>
The iSphere version numbers must match the following pattern:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="2">major.minor.micro.qualifier</tr>
</table>
<p>
The qualifier must be set to <i>r</i> for a release version or <i>bnnn</i> for a beta version, where <i>n</i> is
any positive number between 0 and 9.
<p>
<u>Examples:</u>
<table>
<tr><td nowrap>2.6.0.r</td><td>-</td><td>Release version number.</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap>2.6.0.b004</td><td>-</td><td>Version number of the fourth beta version.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The Eclipse version comparator treats the major, minor and micro part as integer values. But the
qualifier is compared using a string comparator. Therefore we choosed the <i>r</i> for the release and the
<i>b</i> for the beta version to make sure that the release version number is higher than the beta version number.
