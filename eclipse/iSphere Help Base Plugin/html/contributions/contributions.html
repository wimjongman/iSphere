<h1>Contributions to the iSphere Project</h1>
<p>
We are open to programmers who want to contribute their ideas and manpower to the iSphere project. If you
think you are good in RPG and if you know how to write Eclipse plug-ins, you are invited to join the
iSphere project team. 
<p>
We apologize to everybody who wants to join the iSphere project but who do not yet know how to write Eclipse 
plug-ins. We cannot teach you how to write plug-ins, because there is no time left for that beside our
families, the daily work (that we still need to earn money) and the iSphere project.
<p>
If you want to join us, drop us an email and let us know about your ideas and experience.
