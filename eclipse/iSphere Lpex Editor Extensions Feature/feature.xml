   <description url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/isphere/">
      The &quot;iSphere Lpex Editor Extensions&quot; feature adds options for commenting
and uncommenting source lines to the Lpex editor as well as options for 
indenting and unindenting source lines. It is mainly
intended to be used with WDSCi but you can also install it for
RDi, if you want to get the same actions and behavior for both
development environments. RDi 8.0+ uses Ctrl+/ and Ctrl+\ for
commenting and uncommenting source lines, whereas WDSCi 7.0 lacks
these options. Both development environments have no shortcuts for
indenting and unindenting source lines.
