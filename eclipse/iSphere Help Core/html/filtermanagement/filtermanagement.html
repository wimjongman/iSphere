<h1>RSE Filter Management</h1>
<p>
With iSphere RSE Filter Management you can export single or all filters from your workspace to a 
repository (XML File). You can import single or all filters from a repository to your workspace. The 
filters in the workspace and in the repository will be provided in four separate areas.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Filters only in workspace.</li>
<li>Filters only in repository.</li>
<li>Filters in workspace and in repository with different type or filter string.</li>
<li>Filters in workspace and in repository with equal type and filter string.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the areas you can define actions for the filters you want to perform. The actions are.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Push to workspace.</li>
<li>Push to repository.</li>
<li>Delete from workspace.</li>
<li>Delete from repository.</li>
<li>Delete from both.</li>
</ul>
<p>
After defining all actions for the specific filters you have to perform the actions. The changes 
will be applied.
<p>
There are several scenarios you might find this new feature useful.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your workspace is corrupted and you have the need to create a new one. In this case you can 
export your filters from the old workspace and import them into the new one.</li>
<li>You want to share your filters with your colleagues.</li>
<li>You have RDi installed on a computer in your office and at home and want to synchronize 
your filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
