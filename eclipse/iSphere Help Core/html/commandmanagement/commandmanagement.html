	<h1>RSE Command Management</h1>
	<p>With iSphere RSE Command Management you can export some or all
		commands from your workspace to a repository. A repository is an XML
		file on your local PC or a network drive. You can then import some or
		all commands from a repository to your workspace. The repository can
		act as a backup for your commands.
	<p>Here are some other scenarios where you might find Command
		Management useful:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your workspace is corrupted and you need to create a new one.
			In this case you can export your commands from the old workspace and
			import them into the new one.</li>
		<li>You want to share your commands with your colleagues.</li>
		<li>You have RDi installed on a computer in your office and at
			home and want to synchronize your commands.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To open the iSphere RSE Command Management dialog, open the <i>iSphere</i> menu 
		click on the <i>Sun</i> icon labeled with <i>RSE Command Management</i>.

	<h2>Choosing what to Manage</h2>
	<p>You now need to specify what you want to manage, and also the
		repository name:
	<p>
	<p>

	<h3>Editing Area</h3>
	<p>The commands in the workspace and in the repository will be
		displayed in up to four separate horizontal panes.
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Edit workspace and repository commands</li>
		<li>Edit only workspace commands</li>
		<li>Edit only repository commands</li>
	</ul>

	Click the appropriate button. The default,
	<i>Edit workspace and repository commands</i>, is suitable for the first
	time you want to create a new repository. With this option you can:
	<ul>
	<li>Push commands from the workspace to the repository and vice versa.</li>
	<li>Delete commands from the workspace.</li>
	<li>Delete commands from the repository.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The next two option, <i>Edit only workspace commands</i> and 
	<i>Edit only repository commands</i> are suitable for removing commands from
	the workspace or the repository.
	<h3>Profile</h3>
	Select the profile that contains the commands you want to manage.
	<h3>Single Compile Type</h3>
	If this is checked, then you will need to select a compile type using
	the	<i>Compile Type</i> drop down. Only commands of the selected compile type
	will be considered for action, and the compile type name will not be
	saved.
	<P>If this is unchecked, then all commands will be considered for
		action and the connections between commands and compile types will be
		saved.
	<h3>Compile Type</h3>
	Use this option to specify the compile type you want to manage, when 
	<i>Single compile type</i> is checked.
	<h3>Repository</h3>
	Specify the location and name of the repository. A single compile type
	repository must have a suffix of
	<b> .rsecmd</b> and a repository for all commands must have a suffix of
	<b> .rsecmdall</b>.
	<p>
	<h2>Managing Commands</h2>
	Basically managing commands follows the pattern of managing filters. Therefore
	you are asked to refer to chapter <a href="../filtermanagement/filtermanagement.html#exporting_all_filters_for_the_first_time">RSE Filter Managing</a>
	to see how managing RSE resources works.
