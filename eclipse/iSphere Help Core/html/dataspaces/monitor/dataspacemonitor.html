<h1>Data Space Monitor</h1>
The <i>Data Space Monitor</> is used for monitoring the data of your data space objects. Prior you
can use the monitor for a specific object, you need to go to the 
<a href="../designer/dataspaceeditordesigner.html"><i>Data Space Editor Designer</i></a> and create an editor 
for it. 
<p>
Once you have one or more editors for your space object, you can start the monitor from the context menu
of the RSE tree. In case you have more than one editor for the selected object, you need to select the
desired editor from the dialog that showed up:
<p>
<img src="assets/dialog_select_editor.gif" 
     width="250" height="300" 
     align="middle">
<p>
Now the monitor is opened and the content of your data space shows up as defined by the editor.
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor.gif" 
     width="651" height="252" 
     align="middle">
<p>
You can add a watch marker to every field of the dialog from the context menu of the item. A watched icon
is decorated like this: 
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor_watched_item.gif" 
     width="651" height="252" 
     align="middle">
<p>
When the view is refreshed and the value of the item has changed, it is painted with a yellow background:
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor_value_changed.gif" 
     width="651" height="252" 
     align="middle">
<p>
Cool, isn't it?
