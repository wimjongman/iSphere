<h1>Data Space Monitor</h1>
<img src="assets/dataspacemonitor.png" 
     width="64" height="64" 
     style="float:right; margin-left:60px; margin-right:20px;  margin-bottom:40px" border=0></a>
The <i>Data Space Monitor</> is used for monitoring the data of your data space objects. Prior you
can use the monitor for character data areas with mixed data or user spaces, you need to go to the 
<a href="../designer/dataspaceeditordesigner.html"><i>Data Space Editor Designer</i></a> and create an editor 
for it. 
<p>
For simple character data areas or decimal or logical data areas that is not required, because the monitor 
can generate an editor for it. But of course it cannot know anything about user spaces or data areas with
mixed data.  
<p>
Once you have one or more editors for your data space object, you can start the monitor from the context menu
of the RSE tree. In case you have more than one editor for the selected object, you need to select the
desired editor from the dialog that pops up:
<p>
<img src="assets/dialog_select_editor.gif" 
     width="250" height="300" 
     align="middle">
<p>
Now the monitor is opened and the content of your data space shows up as defined by the editor.
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor.gif" 
     width="756" height="227" 
     align="middle">
<p>
You can add a watch marker to every field of the dialog from the context menu of the item. A watched icon
is decorated like this: 
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor_watched_item.gif" 
     width="756" height="227" 
     align="middle">
<p>
When the view is refreshed and the value of the item has changed, it is painted with a yellow background:
<p>
<img src="assets\monitor_value_changed.gif" 
     width="756" height="227" 
     align="middle">
<p>
Cool, isn't it?
<p>

the Eclipse preferences.</td></tr>

<h2>Invalid Data Warning</h2>
<p>
If the monitor encounters a problem when copying the data to the screen, it displays the following 
message at the bottom, right corner of the view:
<p>
<img src="assets\invalid_data_warning.gif" 
     width="542" height="19" 
     align="middle">

<p>
If you see that message, you should carefully check whether or not the fields of your editor are
properly defined regarding to offset and length.
<p>
<h2>Invalid Data Error</h2>
<p>
If the monitor encounters a serious problem when copying the data to the screen, it displays the

<p>
<img src="assets\invalid_data_error.gif" 
     width="591" height="19" 
     align="middle">

<p>
If you see that message, you should carefully check whether or not the fields of your editor are
properly defined regarding to offset and length.
