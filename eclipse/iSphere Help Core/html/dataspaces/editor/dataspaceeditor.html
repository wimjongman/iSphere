The <i>Data Space Editor</i> is used to edit data areas as well as user spaces.
In contrast to the native data area editor, it needs to know the layout of the
data area or user space that it shall work for. The layout is defined by what we call an <i>editor</i>,
that is created and maintained by the 
<a href="../../dataspaces/designer/dataspaceeditordesigner.html"><i>iSphere Data Space Editor Designer</i></a>.
<p>
The concept of <i>Data Space Editors</i> is useful for data areas and user spaces that contain a
data structure of data.
<p>
Once you have one or more editors for your data space object, you can start the editor from the context menu
of the RSE tree. In case you have more than one editor for the selected object, you need to select the
desired editor from the dialog that pops up:
<p>

     width="250" height="300" 
     align="middle">
<p>
Now the editor is opened and the content of your data space shows up as defined by the editor.

<p>
<h2>Object Locks</h2>
<p>
The data space editor adds an <i>Exclusive Allow Read</i> lock (*EXCLRD) to the object in order to 
prevent other jobs from changing the data concurrently. That is similar to what for example the 
LPEX editor does when it opens a source member in edit mode.
