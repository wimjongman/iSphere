	<h1>Source File Compare/Merge Editor</h1>
	<p>The Compare/Merge Editor allows you to compare and merge source
		physical file members. The results of the compare are shown in left
		and right panes and you can easily copy some or all of the differences
		from the right pane to the left pane.
	<p>To compare/merge source physical file members:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu (right
			click) of a source physical file member. This is the source file that
			will be opened in the left pane.</li>
		<li>Select menu item "iSphere Compare Editor".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<div>
		<img src="assets/compare_merge_select.png" align="middle"
			style="float: left; margin-right: 5em";> <br>
		<p>Set the Mode for the compare:
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
			<li>Use "Open for browse" or "Open for edit" to specify how the
				left pane of the compare opens.</li>
			<li>Use "Don't consider date" or "Consider date" to specipy if
				the date field in each source line will be used in the compare.</li>
			<li>Use "Don't ignore case" of "Ignore case" to specify if the
				compare should be case sensitive of insensitive.</li>
			<li>Use "Two way compare" to compare two source members.</li>
			<li>Use "Three way compare" to include an ancestor to the source
				in the right pane.<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<p>Note that in the &quot;Left&quot; section the name of the
			source member for the left pane is specified and cannot be changed.</p>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<p>
			In the "Right" section the Library, File and Menber have been
			defaulted to the &quot;Left&quot; values. <br>Change as needed
			to specify the source member that is to be compared to the source
			member in the "Left" section.
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		Click the [OK] button to start the compare.

		<p style="clear: both;"">
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
	</div>
	<p>The coompare tab opens, showing the differences.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/compare_merge_editor.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<p>There are 4 buttons in the top righr corner if you opened the
		left pane for browse, and 6 buttons if you opened it for edit. Use
		these buttons to move from change to change, and to copy lines form the
		right pane to the left pane. (Hover over each button for help text.)
	<p>

	<p>
	<p>Today there are a couple of restriction to know about:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Notice: The date of copied source lines is
				set to the current date, regardless of the "Don't consider date" or
				"Consider date" setting. This cannot be changed yet, due to
				restrictions in the Eclipse compare support.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Notice: It is impossible to exclude a range
				of columns from source compare, due to restrictions in the Eclipse
				compare support.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>It might be possible to fix both issues with the next release of
		RDi, provided that IBM/Rational updates the Eclipse version.

	<h2>Selecting Multiple Members at Once</h2>
	<p>
	<h3>Two Members</h3>
	<p>
		If two members are selected at once, the first member is the <i>Left
			member</i> and the second one is the <i>Right member</i>. <p>The members can
		be switched with the switch member button located between the &quot;Left&quot;
		and &quot;Right&quot; member sections:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/switch_members_button.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<h3>Three or More Members</h3>
	<p>This is a special case where you want to compare members of the
		same name in different library or source file. For example, comparing
		members at the development level with those in production. You have to
		enter the specifications in the right pane only once.
	<P>Consider this example where we want to compare three members in
		a development library with the same three member in the production
		library.
	<p>We have highlighted the three members in the RSE view, right
		clicked, and clicked "iSphere Compare Editor".
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/three_or_more_members.png" align="middle"
			style="float: none">
	<p>
		In the "Left" section the member is set to <i>*SELECTED</i> and cannot
		be changed. This means that it will be replaced successively by the
		member names that have been selected in the RSE view, and each will be compared
		to the same member in the "Right" section.
	<p>
		In the "Right" section the Connection, Library or File may be changed,
		but the name of the right member is set to <i>*LEFT</i> and cannot be
		changed.
	<p>To compare to the production libary, we set the &quot;File&quot;
		field to ISP_PROD and click [OK]. A compare is run for each selected
		member and a tab opens for each member where there are differences.  In this example, there are no changes in DEMO2.

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Notice: The information message that pops up
				when there are no differences between the members is part of the
				Eclipse compare framework and cannot be disabled with the current
				Eclipse support.</td>
		</tr>
