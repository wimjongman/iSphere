	<h1>Source File Compare/Merge Editor</h1>
	<p>The Compare/Merge Editor allows you to compare and merge source
		physical file members. The results of the compare are shown in left
		and right panes and you can easily copy some or all of the differences
		from the right pane to the left pane.

	<h2>Comparing Remote Members</h2>
	<p>To compare/merge source physical file members:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu (right
			click) of a source physical file member. This is the source file that
			will be opened in the left pane.</li>
		<li>Select menu item "iSphere Compare Editor".</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<div>
		<img src="assets/compare_merge_select.png" align="middle"
			style="float: left; margin-right: 5em";> <br>
		<p>Set the Mode for the compare:
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
			<li>Use "Open for browse" or "Open for edit" to specify how the
				left pane of the compare opens.</li>
			<li>Use "Don't consider date" or "Consider date" to specipy if
				the date field in each source line will be used in the compare.</li>
			<li>Use "Don't ignore case" of "Ignore case" to specify if the
				compare should be case sensitive of insensitive.</li>
			<li>Use "Two way compare" to compare two source members.</li>
			<li>Use "Three way compare" to include an ancestor to the source
				in the right pane.<br>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<p>Note that in the &quot;Left&quot; section the name of the
			source member for the left pane is specified and cannot be changed.</p>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<p>
			In the "Right" section the Library, File and Menber have been
			defaulted to the &quot;Left&quot; values. <br>Change as needed
			to specify the source member that is to be compared to the source
			member in the "Left" section.
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		Click the [OK] button to start the compare.

		<p style="clear: both;"">
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
	</div>
	<p>The compare tab opens, showing the differences.
	<p>
		<img src="assets/compare_merge_editor.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<p>There are 4 buttons in the top right corner if you opened the
		left pane for browse, and 6 buttons if you opened it for edit. Use
		these buttons to move from change to change, and to copy lines from the
		right pane to the left pane. (Hover over each button for help text.)
	<p>

	<p>
	<p>Today there are a couple of restriction to know about:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Note: The date of all source lines is
				set to the current date, when "Don't consider date" is selected 
				and the member is saved from the <i>iSphere Compare/Merge</i> editor. 
				This problem cannot be fixed for WDSC 7.0 and RDi 8.0, due to 
				restrictions in the Eclipse compare support.</td>

	<table>

	<p>The <i>Don't consider date (ignore date)</i> option is also available from the context menu of the

	<h2>Selecting Multiple Members at Once</h2>
	<p>
	<h3>Two Members</h3>
	<p>
		If two members are selected at once, the first member is the <i>Left
			member</i> and the second one is the <i>Right member</i>. <p>The members can
		be switched with the switch member button located between the &quot;Left&quot;
		and &quot;Right&quot; member sections:
	<p>
		<img src="assets/switch_members_button.png" align="middle">
	<p>
	<h3>Three or More Members</h3>
	<p>This is a special case where you want to compare members of the
		same name in different library or source file. For example, comparing
		members at the development level with those in production. You have to
		enter the specifications in the right pane only once.
	<P>Consider this example where we want to compare three members in
		a development library with the same three member in the production
		library.
	<p>We have highlighted the three members in the RSE view, right
		clicked, and clicked "iSphere Compare Editor".
	<p>
	<p>
		<img src="assets/three_or_more_members.png" align="middle"
			style="float: none">
	<p>
		In the "Left" section the member is set to <i>*SELECTED</i> and cannot
		be changed. This means that it will be replaced successively by the
		member names that have been selected in the RSE view, and each will be compared
		to the same member in the "Right" section.
	<p>
		In the "Right" section the Connection, Library or File may be changed,
		but the name of the right member is set to <i>*LEFT</i> and cannot be
		changed.
	<p>To compare to the production libary, we set the &quot;File&quot;
		field to ISP_PROD and click [OK]. A compare is run for each selected
		member and a tab opens for each member where there are differences.  In this example, there are changes only  in DEMO1 and DEMO3 so there are two compare tabs.  There are no changes in DEMO2.
	<p>

	<p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td class="notice">Note: The information message that pops up
				when there are no differences between the members is part of the
				Eclipse compare framework and cannot be disabled with the current
				Eclipse support.</td>

	<h2>Starting The Compare Editor From an Lpex Editor</h2>
	<p>The iSphere compare editor can be started from the context menu of a Lpex 
	   editor. Select <i>Source -> Compare...</i> to do so. Please notice that:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no edit option when the compare editor is started from an Lpex editor.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<a id="#comparing_i_project_members" />
	<h2>Comparing i Project Member</h2>
	<p>When the iSphere compare editor is started from an Lpex editor with a source member loaded
	   from an i Project, then the following additional rules are enforced:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no edit option for i Project members.</li>
	<li>When the i Project member does not have sequence numbers and date fields, the <i>Consider date</i> option 
	    is not available and sequence numbers and last changed dates are not displayed at all.</li>
	</ul>
