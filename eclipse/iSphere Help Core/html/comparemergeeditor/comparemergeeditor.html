<h1>Source File Compare/Merge Editor</h1>
<p>
The Compare/Merge Editor gives you the ability to compare/merge source physical 
file members.
<p>
To compare/merge source physical file members do the following.
<p>
<ul>
<li>In the Remote Systems Explorer open the context menu for a source physical 
file member.</li>
<li>Select menu item "iSphere Compare Editor".</li>
</ul>
<p>

     align="middle">
<p>
Enter the name of the source member that you want to compare the selected source 
member with and click the <i>OK</i> button.
<p>

     align="middle">
<p>
Today there are a couple of restriction to know:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td class="notice" >Notice: The date of the source lines are set to the current 
date, if the <i>Ignore Date</i> option is selected. That cannot be change for today, 
due to restrictions in the Eclipse compare support.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<table>
<tr><td class="notice" >Notice: It is impossible to exclude a range of columns from 
source compare, due to restrictions in the Eclipse compare support.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
It might be possible to fix both issues with the next release of RDi, provided that 
IBM/Rational updates the Eclipse version.

<h2>Selecting Multiple Members at Once</h2>
<p>
<h3>Two Members</h3>
<p>
If two members are selected at once, the first member is the <i>Left member</i> and the 
second one is the <i>Right member</i>. The members can be switched with the switch member
button between the left and right member sections:
<p>

     align="middle">
<p>
<h3>Three or More Members</h3>
<p>
If three or more members are selected, the left member is set to <i>*SELECTED</i>
and the name of the right member is set to <i>*LEFT</i> and cannot be changed.
<p>

     align="middle">
<p>
When the <i>OK</i> button is clicked, a compare dialog is opened for each selected member.
<p>
This option is useful, when comparing members with the same name but different source files,
e.g. members of the development level and members of the production level. 
<p>
<table>
<tr><td class="notice" >Notice: The information message that pops up, when there are no 
differences between the members, is part of the Eclipse compare framework and cannot be 
disabled, today.</td></tr>
